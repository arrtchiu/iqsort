Interactive (quick?) sort

## WTF?

I needed to rank a list of items but I was having a lot of trouble. I figured I could decide A or B was relatively more important but got overwhelmed with a large list. So, why not use a computer algorithm?

## Building / Installing

Simplest way: just run `make` and it'll build and install to `_build`.
